        "Hi, I’m Abel Sifuna, I completed my secondary education 
        at Tumaini House School, achieving a C grade. Passionate 
        about building both Web2 and Web3 applications. 
        I craft responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and Python, 
        and I dive into Solidity to develop decentralized identity 
        and reputation systems with zk-SNARKs and Soulbound Tokens. 
        Whether it's designing a sleek frontend or engineering smart 
        contracts, I thrive on innovation. Let’s build something 
        amazing together!"
